## About Me

I'm a Backend Developer with 2+ years of experience building secure and scalable enterprise systems using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. Currently working at Allianz Türkiye, where I design and maintain backend services for pension (BES) and life insurance products.

I specialize in layered backend architecture, BFF (Backend for Frontend) design patterns, and RESTful API development. I'm also experienced in CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and Kubernetes deployments. My domain focus on financial services has given me strong insight into contract lifecycles and complex business rules.
